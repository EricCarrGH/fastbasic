Atari 5200 console support
==========================

*Note: This is an appendix to the main FastBasic manual.*

The FastBasic cross compiler supports the Atari 5200 console as a target,
allowing to port programs from the Atari 8-bit computers with minor
modifications.


RAM Usage
---------

The Atari 5200 console has only 16kb of RAM, this means that you have to
minimize RAM usage in your program.

For compatibility with most programs, `DLI` and `DATA` statements are stored in
RAM, this means that you should put big `DATA` statements in ROM by using the
construct:

    DATA mydata() BYTE ROM = 1, 2, 3, ....
    DATA font() BYTEFILE ROM "myfont.fnt"

Note that DATA in ROM can't be modified at runtime, so you must select the type
appropriately.


Operating System support
------------------------

The Atari 5200 console lacks the OS ROM of the Atari 8-bit computers, so all
the functionality that depends on the OS must be reimplemented.

Currently, the target lacks:

- Floating point support: only integer operations are supported.
- Graphics modes: the included runtime only implements graphic modes 0, 1, 2, 7
  to 13 and 15.
- Text window: the graphic modes with a text window are not implemented.
- Filled lines: only PLOT and DRAWTO are implemented, there is no `FILLTO`
  command.
- Input/Output: Only the screen output an keypad input are supported, there is
  no I/O channels, `OPEN` or `XIO`.


Hardware Registers
------------------

The Atari 5200 changes the location of hardware registers for POKEY (from $D200
to $D800) and GTIA (from $D000 to $C000), so direct `POKE`s to memory must be
changed.

Also, `DLI` support also needs to change the address of color and P/M registers,
you can use this table for useful registers:

|Address| Register                  |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| $C000 | Player 0 horizontal pos.  |
| $C001 | Player 1 horizontal pos.  |
| $C002 | Player 2 horizontal pos.  |
| $C003 | Player 3 horizontal pos.  |
| $C004 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C005 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C006 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C007 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C012 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C013 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C014 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C015 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C016 | Color register 0          |
| $C017 | Color register 1          |
| $C018 | Color register 2          |
| $C019 | Color register 3          |
| $C01A | Color of Background       |

Also remember that the Atari 5200 does not have a PIA, console keys and
keyboard, all controllers are analog and have a keypad.

FastBasic emulates the standard 8-bit joystick, so the `STICK()` and `STRIG()`
functions return the same values.
