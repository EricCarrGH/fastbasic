BW-DOS is a disk operating system for
8-bit ATARI computers with at least
48kB RAM, and at least one disk drive.
It is designed to be compatible with
SpartaDOS, and to use as little memory
as possible. In addition, several small
bugs known from SpartaDOS are not in
BW-DOS, especially problems with XF551.
BW-DOS may be used separately, or as a
"junior version" for SpartaDOS users.

BW-DOS may be freely used and distri-
buted under following conditions:

- Only the whole and unchanged master
  disk may be distributed,
- It may not be sold, excepting little
  costs in PD services,
- When used as a part of another
  software package, the whole package
  may be marked with a "(C)", sold
  etc.; in this case it's possible
  to exclude files from BW-DOS, but
  all distributed files still must be
  unchanged, and an information where
  the whole BW-DOS is available must
  be included.
