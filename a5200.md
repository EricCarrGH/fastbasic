Atari 5200 console support
==========================

*Note: This is an appendix to the main FastBasic manual.*

The FastBasic cross compiler supports the Atari 5200 console as a target,
allowing to port programs from the Atari 8-bit computers with minor
modifications.


Controllers Support
-------------------

The Atari 5200 does not have standard digital joysticks, console keys and
keyboard, all controllers are analog and have a keypad.

FastBasic emulates the standard 8-bit joystick and keyboard using the
controllers for easy porting:

- The `STICK()` and `STRIG()` functions return the same values as in the
  computers.

- The `PTRIG()` function returns the state of the secondary button for the
  controllers.

- The `PADDLE()` functions return the analog value of each controller axis,
  so `PADDLE(0)` and `PADDLE(1)` are the horizontal and vertical axis of the
  first controller respectively, and so on with the next 4 controllers.

- The `GET` statement waits for a key pressed on any controller, the value
  returned is from 0 to 15 for the first controller, 16 to 31 for the second,
  etc.

- The `KEY()` function returns the last pressed key on *any* controller,
  or 0 if no key was pressed.

The values returned by `GET` are given in the following table, note that you
can *and* the number with 15 to get the number of the first controller, this
is useful to accept keys from all controllers in your code:


|Key   | Controller 1 | Controller 2 | Controller 3 | Controller 4 |
|------| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
|`0`   |   0  |  16  |  32  |  48  |
|`1`   |   1  |  17  |  33  |  49  |
|`2`   |   2  |  18  |  34  |  50  |
|`3`   |   3  |  19  |  35  |  51  |
|`4`   |   4  |  20  |  36  |  52  |
|`5`   |   5  |  21  |  37  |  53  |
|`6`   |   6  |  22  |  38  |  54  |
|`7`   |   7  |  23  |  39  |  55  |
|`8`   |   8  |  24  |  40  |  56  |
|`9`   |   9  |  25  |  41  |  57  |
|`*`   |  10  |  26  |  42  |  58  |
|`#`   |  11  |  27  |  43  |  59  |
|Start |  12  |  28  |  44  |  60  |
|Pause |  13  |  29  |  45  |  61  |
|Reset |  14  |  30  |  46  |  62  |

The value returned by the `KEY()` function is always 255 minus the numbers
above, for example, when pressing the key `4` in the second controller, `KEY()`
will return 255-20 = 235.



RAM Usage
---------

The Atari 5200 console has only 16kb of RAM, this means that you have to
minimize RAM usage in your program.

For compatibility with most programs, `DLI` and `DATA` statements are stored in
RAM, this means that you should put big `DATA` statements in ROM by using the
construct:

    DATA mydata() BYTE ROM = 1, 2, 3, ....
    DATA font() BYTEFILE ROM "myfont.fnt"

Note that DATA in ROM can't be modified at runtime, so you must select the type
appropriately.


Operating System support
------------------------

The Atari 5200 console lacks the OS ROM of the Atari 8-bit computers, so all
the functionality that depends on the OS must be reimplemented.

Currently, the target lacks:

- Floating point support: only integer operations are supported.
- Graphics modes: the included runtime only implements graphic modes 0, 1, 2, 7
  to 13 and 15.
- Text window: the graphic modes with a text window are not implemented.
- Filled lines: only PLOT and DRAWTO are implemented, there is no `FILLTO`
  command.
- Input/Output: Only the screen output an keypad input are supported, there is
  no I/O channels, `OPEN` or `XIO`.


Hardware Registers
------------------

The Atari 5200 changes the location of hardware registers for POKEY (from $D200
to $D800) and GTIA (from $D000 to $C000), so direct `POKE`s to memory must be
changed.

Also, `DLI` support also needs to change the address of color and P/M registers,
you can use this table for useful registers:

|Address| Register                  |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| $C000 | Player 0 horizontal pos.  |
| $C001 | Player 1 horizontal pos.  |
| $C002 | Player 2 horizontal pos.  |
| $C003 | Player 3 horizontal pos.  |
| $C004 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C005 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C006 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C007 | Missile 0 horizontal pos. |
| $C012 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C013 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C014 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C015 | Color of Player 0         |
| $C016 | Color register 0          |
| $C017 | Color register 1          |
| $C018 | Color register 2          |
| $C019 | Color register 3          |
| $C01A | Color of Background       |
