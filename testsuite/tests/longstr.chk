Name: Check for parsing of long strings
Test: run
Output:
this is a really long string, with more that 250 bytes of length in the line.... abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 0123456789 " and even included quotes ", testing if parser can handle it. also, the editor should cope with this.
